Meme to Game.


Istrit Payter (2025) — Web/Mobile Game Project


This was my attempt to create the infamous Istrit Payter meme by IJI into a game. The idea starts when I was browsing through Facebook last month of July (2025) and stumbled upon a hilarious meme about a character named Istrit Payter. The meme featured Malupiton who fights other pinoy meme characters with super powers, accompanied by humorous captions that poked fun at various aspects of Pinoy culture.


While I am learning javascript and making sample games with that language, I had thought it would be better to use the language to make the meme into a game. So without any planning, I just go with the flow making the game developing the fighters, stage, ui, controls handlers, and much more logic in pure javascript and from scratch.


Tools used in making the game:


1. Visual Studio Code - for coding the game logic and structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


2. Adobe Photoshop/Graphics Gale - for creating and editing the game graphics, including characters, sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements.


3. Audacity - for editing sound effects and background music for the game.


4. Browser Developer Tools - for testing and debugging the game during development like console logging and finding the appropriate key values for controls.


Funny how it was stored first in my telegram because I don't have github and I don't know how to use it back then. But now I have a github account and I uploaded the updated source code there.


You can check the game and source code on the links section. Thank you for those who support me in making this game. Special thanks to sir IJI for making the original meme and inspiring me to make this game.❤️
